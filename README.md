# AO3 Enhancement Suite
AO3 Enhancement Suite is a browser extension that aims to improve upon the already great experience on [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org) by adding various additional features and niceties.

# Installation
This extension is now available from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ao3-enhancement-suite/bhmneclegcomgehhnoielpcmgjbamblj) and the [Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ao3-enhancement-suite/).

# Features
## Search Presets
This feature allows you to easily save and reload search setting presets. If you ever have a really fine tuned search to find works you're looking for and want to save it, this is the feature for you!

It can be used via the panel added to the top of the [Work Search](https://archiveofourown.org/works/search) page.

## Tag Collapse
This feature collapses excessive tags into a button by default. This allows you to browse without worrying about your screen being cluttered by works with many tags.

You can also customise the threshold allowed before tags are collapsed.

## Work Stats
### Average words per chapter
This feature adds an "Average words per chapter" stat to multi-chapter works so you can easily get an idea of how long it might take to read through each chapter of a longer work.

### Estimated reading time
This feature adds an "Estimated reading time" stat to works so you can get a more specific idea of how long it may take to read a work. 

You can customise the words-per-minute used to calculate this statistic in the extension's settings to your own personal reading speed.
