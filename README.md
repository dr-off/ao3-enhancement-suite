# AO3 Enhancement Suite

AO3 Enhancement Suite is a browser extension that aims to improve upon the already great experience on AO3 by adding various additional features.

# Features
## Search Presets
This feature allows you to easily save and reload search setting presets. If you ever have a really fine tuned search to find works you're looking for and want to save it, this is the feature for you!

It can be used via the panel added to the top of the [Work Search](https://archiveofourown.org/works/search) page.

## Work Stats
### Average words per chapter
This feature adds an "Average words per chapter" stat to multi-chapter works so you can easily get an idea of how long it might take to read through each chapter of a longer work.

# Installation
This extension is now available from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ao3-enhancement-suite/bhmneclegcomgehhnoielpcmgjbamblj) and the [Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ao3-enhancement-suite/).
